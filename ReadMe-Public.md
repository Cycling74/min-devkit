Create packages and code objects for Max using C++




## Two Options

1. Open the Launcher and **use Max** to generate new packages, add new objects to existing packages, and launch Xcode / Visual Studio
2. Take control of the underlying technology stack yourself: **[use Github](https://github.com/Cycling74/min-devkit)** and the instructions in the ReadMe there to get started.

The information that follow pertains only to the first of these options. 



## Prerequisites

You can use the objects provided in this package as-is.

To code your own objects, or to re-compile existing objects, you will need a compiler:

* On the Mac this means **Xcode 7 or later** (you can get from the App Store for free). 
* On Windows this means **Visual Studio 2015 or 2017** (you can download a free version from Microsoft). The installer for Visual Studio 2017 offers an option to install Git, which you should choose to do. **Visual Studio 2017 is recommended and is required if you are writing Graphical User Interface objects**.
